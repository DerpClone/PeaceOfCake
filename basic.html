      <p class="space">Getting the right amount of flour before you attempt a baking recipe is a must. Mismatched proportions of flour can really mess up the taste of your baking goods!! &nbsp
        Here we will tell you how to measure flour correctly before attempting the recipe.
        Many beginners make the mistake of thinking that a measurement cup is the way to go when getting the right amount. However this is rarely the case as when people use
        the cups to scoop out, there is always an excess of flour gained from packing. This slight difference can change up how the baked good tastes like. In order to get just the right amount, a spoon is used carry the flour into a measuring cup and a clean flat knife is used to cut off the excess flour

    <div class="square">
    <p class="space">Caramel sauce can enhance the taste of your baked goods by a mile. It can be a daunting task to make them if you dont have the know how.
      Messing up when you were making a caramel can be a nightmare to clean up after as they will be stuck to your pan!
      Dont worry! Here is how to make caramel sauce in a jiffy. <br>
      Firstly,there are two ways to make caramel sauce. Dry method, slowly heating sugar until it melts and is deemed as a bit more difficult.
      The wet method is more common and is what you will find in today’s recipe. Give your undivided attention to the caramel sauce while you are preparing it. Caramel is HOT! Be careful. For reference- Water boils at 212°F, we are taking this sugar mixture over 350 degrees, so it’s incredibly hot.Avoid a caramel catastrophe by making sure your heavy bottomed pot is large enough. Trust me; you do not want this caramel sauce to boil over onto your stove. It will bring you to tears. When you’re done, be sure to soak your pot and tools with hot water to help the cleaning process.

  <h2>Making Buttermilk</h2>

  <img src="imgs/budder.jpg" alt="Flour" class="image" style="width:70%">
  <div class="square">
  <p class="space"> I cannot tell you how many times I’ve started pulling out the ingredients for a recipe and realized that I didn’t have any buttermilk on hand. It’s just not something that is regularly in our fridge. Buttermilk is definitely an ingredient you don’t want to omit. Creamy and tangy, it brings beautiful flavor and tenderness to sweet and savory recipes. All you need to make a substitute for buttermilk in baking recipes is milk and white vinegar, or lemon juice. I typically opt for 2% or whole milk and fresh lemon juice, but bottled will also do the trick.

Measure one tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice into a liquid measuring cup.

Add in a scant cup of milk and fill to the 1 cup measurement line.

Stir the mixture together and let sit for 5 minutes. Once the buttermilk and vinegar (or lemon juice) mixture has rested for 5 minutes, the milk will have thickened and curdled slightly.

That means it worked! You can now use your buttermilk substitute 1-for-1 in your favorite baking recipes. If your recipe calls for 1 cup of buttermilk, use 1 cup of buttermilk substitute, ½ cup for ½ cup and so on.
